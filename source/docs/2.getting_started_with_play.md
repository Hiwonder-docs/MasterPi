**2.2.1 Robot Control**

(1) This game allows you to control the movement of the car and the RGB light on the ultrasonic sensor in real time. The interface consists of four parts, and the descriptions and function icons of each part are shown below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image5.png"   />

The interface of "Robot Control" can be divided into three parts. The left side of the interface can control the movement of the robotic arm by dragging the slider. Other function icons can refer to the following table:

| Icon | **Corresponding Function** |
|:------------:|:----------------------------:|
| <img src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image6.png"   /> | Drag to control MasterPi’s movement. |
| <img src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image7.0.png"   /> | Control the rotation direction of MasterPi. |
| <img src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image7.png"   /> | Control MasterPi back to the initial posture. |
| <img src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image8.png"  /> | The battery voltage of the MasterPi will be displayed in the lower right corner of the image. Note: when the battery voltage is less than 7V, please charge it as soon as possible. |

The real-time image transmitted by camera indicates voltage value of MasterPi’s battery. Note: when the battery voltage is less than 7V, please charge it as soon as possible.

The right side of the interface can be used to control the angle of 5 servos so as to control the movement of the robotic arm. 

If you want to back to the games option interface, you can click the blank area, then the title bar will appear. Next, click<img src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image9.png"  />at the left side. 

**2.2.2 Color Recognition** 

This game can recognize red, green, and blue. The robotic arm will nod when it detects red and shake its head when it detects blue or green.

:::{Note}

* Please start this game under a well-lit environment, but try to keep it from direct light.
* When recognizing, please do not have the same or similar colored object within the detected range to avoid interference.
* If the recognition effect is not good enough, please refer to  "[Quick User Experience\ 3.Color Threshold Adjustment]()".
:::

(1) Click "Color Recognition" to enter this game. Its interface consists three parts:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image10.png"  />

① The status bar is located at the top of the interface.

② The left side of the interface is the area for enabling, disabling the game and adjusting the color threshold.

③ The right side of the interface is the area for displaying the live camera feed.

(2) Clicking the "Start Recognition" allows you to place red, blue, and green objects one by one in front of the camera. Take green as an example. When green is detected, the MasterPi will highlight the recognized green area in the feedback image. The buzzer will emit a "beep" sound, then the camera will perform a "head-shaking" action.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image11.png"   />

The green will be recognized and highlighted in the live camera feed.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image11.png"   />

The buzzer will emit a "beep" sound, and the recognized color will be displayed in the lower left corner.

| Recognized Color | Outcome                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Red              | The buzzer emits a "beep" sound, and the camera nods its head. |
| Green            | The buzzer emits a "beep" sound, and the camera shakes its head. |
| Blue             | The buzzer emits a "beep" sound, and the camera shakes its head. |

(3) If want to back to mode selection interface, you can arbitrarily click the blank area in interface, then click <img src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image9.png" style="width:45px" />.

**2.2.3 Color Sorting**

Click "Color Sorting" to enter the game interface. After starting the game, the car's camera can recognize different color blocks to perform corresponding actions.

:::{Note}

* When recognizing QR codes, it is important to maintain an optimal distance between the QR code image and the camera. It is 35cm.

* Please start this game under a well-lit environment, but try to keep it from direct light.

(1) Click the "Start Recognition" to select different color blocks, and the MasterPi will perform corresponding actions upon recognizing different color blocks.

| Recognized Color | Outcome                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Red              | The buzzer emits a "beep" sound and places the red block at coordinates (-15, 14, 2). |
| Green            | The buzzer emits a "beep" sound and places the green block at coordinates (-18, 9, 3). |
| Blue             | The buzzer emits a "beep" sound and places the blue block at coordinates (-18, 0, 2). |

(2) If want to back to mode selection interface, you can arbitrarily click the blank area in interface, then click<img src="../_static/media/2.getting_started_with_play/2.1/image9.png"  />.

**2.2.4 Target Tracking**

:::{Note}

* Please start this game under a well-lit environment, but try to keep it from direct light.
* When recognizing, please do not have the same or similar colored object within the detected range to avoid interference.
* If the recognition effect is not good enough, please refer to  "[Quick User Experience\ 3. Color Threshold Adjustment]().
:::

(1) Please select both "Pan-tilt Tracking" and "Car Following" simultaneously for car tracking.
