<img class="common_img" style="width:400px" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.4/image7.png"  alt="loading" />

**1.6.3 Startup Instruction**

(1) Switch the battery box to "ON", and push the switch on the Raspberry Pi expansion board from "OFF" to "ON". The LED1 and LED2 on the Raspberry Pi will remain on. After a short while, LED2 will change from being constantly on to flashing every 1 second. The pan-tilt will return to its initial position, and the buzzer will make a "beep" sound, indicating that the device has successfully powered on.

:::{Note}

The Raspberry Pi itself is also a computer and takes a short period to start up. The boot-up time is approximately 30 seconds, so please wait with the patient.

:::

:::{Note}

* LED1 is the signal indicator, which lights up when the device is powered on and remains on during operation. When the Raspberry Pi communicates with the expansion board, it will flash once.
* LED2 is the communication indicator. The default network connection mode of the device before delivery is AP mode. After successful startup, it will flash every 1 second. If it is set to LAN mode, LED2 will remain on. For information on network connection mode settings and introductions, please refer to the tutorials in the same chapter as this section.
* During device operation, if the LED1 and LED2 lights dim and remain constantly on, it indicates that the power supply is low and needs to be charged.
:::

(2) After successful startup, the device defaults to AP mode before delivery and generates a hotspot starting with "HW".

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.4/image10.png" style="width:350px"  alt="loading" />

**1.6.4 Activate Self-check Program**

After successful startup, the MasterPi can initiate the self-check service by pressing a button. This is used to detect the servos and motors of the MasterPi, helping you troubleshoot wiring issues.

## 1.8 Adjust Pan-Tilt

**1.8.1 Whether the deviation needs to be adjusted**

The robotic arm may generate a certain deviation after assembling and you can check it by the following steps: 

(1) Connect MasterPi through VNC. Then click <img src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image2.png" style="width:45px"  alt="loading" /> on system desktop and open PC software. 

(2)  Click "Reset servo" on the PC software interface.

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image3.png"  alt="loading" />

(3) If the robotic arm is straight up, there is no need to adjust the deviation. As the figure shown below:

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image4.png"  alt="loading" />

(4) The deviation needs to be adjusted if the following two situations occur.

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image5.png"  alt="loading" />

**1.8.2 The Causes of Deviation** 

The deviation usually is caused in the following situations:

(1) When the servo is in the initial position, the angle of the servo main shaft is rotated during installing the servo horn, resulting in angular deviation generating in initial position. The default servo angle is in the middle position before delivery.

(2) The angle of the main shaft is not rotated when installing the servo horn, but if there is a small deviation in the direction or angle of the brackets fixed on the servo during installing the brackets, which also cause a slight deviation.  

It should be noted that if the deviation is not adjusted, it may limit the robot movement, thus affecting some sports effects.
In addition, the deviation value within 100 ( an angle of 30°) is in the normal adjustable range. If the value is larger than 100, it can not be adjusted by software. The main shaft screw of the servo with large deviation needs to be removed and rotated to the vertical position and then installed again.

**1.8.3 The Standard of Deviation Adjustment**

After powering on the robotic arm, it will reset to the original position. At this time, the servo brackets needs to be parallel, that is, the screws in the vertical direction of the bracket where the servos are located should be in the same straight line.

**1.8.4 Adjustment Method**

<span id="anchor_5_4_2"></span>

* **Small Deviation Adjustment** 

The small deviation means that value is less than 100 (deviation angle is less than 30°). This lesson takes adjusting No.3 servo as an example. ("Servo reset" operation has been performed) 

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image9.png"  alt="loading" />

(1) Observe the posture of the each servo. It can be seen that No.3 and No.4 servos need to be adjusted. 

(2) Click "Read deviation" and then click "OK" in the pops-up prompt window. 

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image10.png"  alt="loading" />

(3) Click the small slider bar under the ID3 servo and ID4 servos to make all servos in the same straight line.

:::{Note}

Left-click multiple times to adjust the slider accurately.

(4) After the adjustment is complete, click "save deviation" and "OK" to save the deviation into the controller.

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image12.png"  alt="loading" />

(5) Click "reset servo" again and observe whether the deviation adjustment of the robotic arm is consistent with the standard explained in "[1.8.3 the standard of deviation adjustment](#anchor_5_3)". If yes, it means the deviation has been adjusted successfully. If not, return to step 1 and then follow the steps to make fine adjustment.  

* **Large Deviation Adjustment** 

Large deviation means that the value is larger that 100 (the deviation angle is larger than 30°). This lesson takes the following figure as example to adjust. (The "Reset servo" operation has been performed ) 

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image13.png"  alt="loading" />

(1) Observe the posture of the each servo. It can be seen that No.3 servo has large deviation, so it needs to be reinstalled.

(2) Remove the screw on No.3 servo main shaft and the opposite black rivet, then take the metal servo horn off.

:::{Note}
Avoid applying excessive force when adjusting the bracket to prevent deformation.

(3) Remove the metal bracket of the chassis and disconnect the No.3 servo cable.

(4) Connect the No.3 servo cable to the expansion board (red to positive, brown to negative) to center the servo.

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/1.getting_ready/1.6/image8.png"  alt="loading" />

(5) Then, reconnect the servo cable to the No.3 servo interface on the expansion board (red to positive, brown to negative). Align the servo horn in a "+" position and attach it back to the servo main shaft. Reinstall the bracket onto the No.3 servo main shaft and tighten the screw.

(6) Click "servo reset" again and check if the robotic arm aligns with the standard described in "[1.8.3 The Standard of Deviation Adjustment](#anchor_5_3)" If it does, the deviation has been successfully adjusted. For minor deviations, follow the steps in "[1.8.4 Adjustment Method -> Small Deviation Adjustment](#anchor_5_4_2)" for fine-tuning.
