# 3. Mecanum Wheel Car Motion Control Course

## 3.1 The Motion of Mecanum Wheels Car

### 3.1.1  Preface 

MasterPi uses omnidirectional movement mecanum wheels. According to the the included angle 45° between the roller and axle of the mecanum wheels, the wheels can be divided into wheel A and wheel B which are in mirror-image relationship with each other, as the figure shown below:

<img src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.1/image1.png" class="common_img" />

Featuring 360° movement, flexibility and stability, the mecanum wheel is a successful omnidirectional wheels. The combination of four mecanum wheels can be more flexible to realize the omnidirectional movement.

### 3.1.2 Working Principle

* **Mecanum Wheel Hardware Structure** 

<img src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.1/image2.png" class="common_img" />

The mecanum wheel is composed of rollers and axle. The axle is as the main bracket of the whole wheel and a series of rubberized external rollers obliquely attached to the whole circumference of its rim. The rollers at its rim oriented at an angle of 45° to the wheel circumference.
There are several configuration methods of four mecanum wheels, such as AAAA, BBBB, AABB, ABAB, BABA. Not all combination methods of the wheels enable robot car move forward, backward, and sideways, etc. The combination of MasterPi's wheels are ABAB, which can realize omnidirectional movement.

<img src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.1/image3.png" class="common_img"  />

* **Mecanum Wheel Physical Characteristics** 

The omni-directional motion of the vehicle is achieved as the vector summation of propelling forces on the ground-engaging rollers can be in any direction by adjusting the wheel rotation direction and torque magnitude of the four wheels.

Due to the rollers at its rim oriented at an certain angle to the wheel circumference, the mecanum wheels can slip in sideways direction. The generatrix of small rollers are special. When the mecanum wheel revolves around its fixed axle, the envelope of each small roller is a cylindrical surface so that the wheel can roll forward continuously.

(1) V<sub>x</sub>：The velocity of the Mecanum wheel in the X-axis direction (typically front-to-back);

(2) V<sub>y</sub>：The velocity of the Mecanum wheel in the Y-axis direction (typically left-to-right);

(3) V<sub>ω</sub>：The angular velocity of the Mecanum wheel chassis (the speed at which the chassis rotates around its own center);

(4) V<sub>A</sub>、V<sub>B</sub>、V<sub>C</sub>、V<sub>D</sub>：The real-time velocities of the four wheels of the Mecanum wheel;

The motion of the right front wheel within the plane can be decomposed into:

(5) VBx：The velocity of the Mecanum wheel in the X-axis direction (typically front-to-back)

(6) VBy：The velocity of the Mecanum wheel in the Y-axis direction (typically left-to-right);

(7) L：The distance between the wheel centers of the left and right wheels;

(8) H：The distance between the wheel centers of the front and rear wheels;

(9) θ<sub>ω</sub>：The angle formed between the chassis center of gravity and the right front wheel center is 45°.

Based on these parameters, we can conduct the kinematic analysis of the mecanum wheel chassis.

### 3.1.3 Kinematic Analysis Formula Calculation

To simplify the kinematic mathematical model, the following two idealized assumptions are made:

(1) The omni-wheels do not slip on the ground, and the ground provides sufficient friction;

(2) The four wheels are distributed at the four corners of a rectangle or square, with the wheels being parallel to each other.

Here, we decompose the rigid body motion of the vehicle into three components. By calculating the velocities of the four wheels when the vehicle moves along the X+, Y+ directions and rotates along the Z+ direction, we can merge the formulas to determine the wheel speeds required for the "**translation + rotation**" motion composed of these three simple movements.

Where VA、VB、VC、VD are the wheel speeds of wheels A, B, C, and D(the motor speeds); VX is the vehicle's velocity along the X-axis, Vy is the velocity along the Y-axis, and Vω is the rotational speed along the Z-axis; <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>L is half of the vehicle's track width L, and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>H is half of the wheelbase H. 

(1) The velocity components of each wheel when the robot translates along the X-axis can be calculated using the following formula:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.1/image5.png"  />

VA、VB、VC、VD are the real-time speeds of the four mecanum wheels;  is the speed of the mecanum wheels along the X-axis.

(2) The velocity components of each wheel when the robot translates along the Y-axis can be calculated using the following formula:
<img  class="common_img"  src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.1/image6.png"  />

Vy is the speed of the mecanum wheels along the Y-axis.

(3) The velocity components of each wheel when the robot rotates along the Z-axis can be calculated using the following formula:

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.1/image7.png"  />

<img  class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.1/image8.png"  /> is the angular velocity of the mecanum wheel chassis (the rotational speed around its own center.)

(4) By combining the velocities along the X, Y, and Z directions, four wheel speeds can be calculated based on the vehicle's motion state:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.1/image9.png"  />

## 3.2 Move Forward

### 3.2.1 Working Principle

According to the characteristic of mecanum wheel, when the car moves forward, the four wheels must rotate clockwise. The force analysis is shown in the following figure: 

<img src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.2/image2.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px" />

According to physical kinematics, when forces are equal and opposite to each other, they will counteract each other. Any force can be decomposed into two perpendicular vectors. Suppose the speed of wheel A and wheel B rotates at the same speed, a right force decomposed by wheel A and a left force decomposed by wheel B will counteract each other, which the direction of resultant velocity is forward. 
Based on Newton's second law (F=ma), if the direction of acceleration is forward, the final resultant force is also forward.

(3) Call the mecanum.MecanumChassis() function

{lineno-start=24}

```python
chassis = mecanum.MecanumChassis()
```

The call to `mecanum.MecanumChassis()` constructor creates an object of the MecanumChassis class and assigns it to the chassis variable.

(4) Motor Control

{lineno-start=38}

```python
	if __name__ == '__main__':
    while start:
        chassis.set_velocity(50,90,0) # 控制机器人移动函数,线速度50(0~100)，方向角90(0~360)，偏航角速度0(-2~2)(The function controls the movement of a robot at the linear velocity of 50 ranging from 0 to 100, the direction angle of 90 ranging from 0 to 360, and the yaw rate of 0 ranging from -2 to 2.)
        time.sleep(1)
        
    chassis.set_velocity(0,0,0)  # 关闭所有电机(close all motors)
    print('已关闭')
```

Control motors primarily using the set_velocity function. There are three parameters in this function. Take the code `chassis.set_velocity(50,90,0)` as an example:

① The first parameter `50` represents the motor speed, its unit is mm/s and it ranges from -100 to 100. When the value is negative, the motor rotates counterclockwise.

② The second parameter `90` represents the movement direction of car, its unit is degree and it ranges from 0 to 360. The value of 90°refer to move forward. 270°refers to move backward. 0°refers to move to the right. 180°refers to move the left. Other movement directions are obtained according to the same reference method.  

③ The third parameter `0` represents the rotation speed of the car, its unit is  radians per second and it ranges from -2 to 2. When the parameter value is positive, the car will rotate clockwise. When the parameter value is negative, the car will rotate counterclockwise.

## 3.3 Turning

### 3.3.1 Working Principle
According to the characteristics of mecanum wheel , running (all at the same speed) both wheels on one side in one direction while the other side in the opposite direction, will result in a stationary rotation of the chassis car.

Therefore, when the left mecanum wheels rotate clockwise and the right mecanum wheels rotate counterclockwise, the chassis car will be counterclockwise stationary rotation. When the left mecanum wheels rotate clockwise and the right wheels rotates counterclockwise, the chassis car will be clockwise stationary rotation. 

The force analysis of two situation is as follow:

(1) Import Function Library

During initialization, the function library needs to be first imported for subsequent calling. For the detailed content of importing, please refer to **"[3.5.4 Program Analysis \ Import Parameter Module](#anchor_5_5_1)"**.

{lineno-start=1}

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
# coding=utf8
import sys
import time
import signal
import common.mecanum as mecanum
```

(2) Check Python Version

{lineno-start=8}

```python
if sys.version_info.major == 2:
    print('Please run this program with python3!')
    sys.exit(0)
```

sys.version_info.major is used to check the major version of Python. If the version is equal to 2, the program will print a message and exit the program. 

(3) Call the mecanum.MecanumChassis() Function

{lineno-start=25}

```python
chassis = mecanum.MecanumChassis()
```

The call to `mecanum.MecanumChassis()` constructor creates an object of the `MecanumChassis` class and assigns it to the chassis variable.

(4) Motor Control

{lineno-start=39}

```python
	if __name__ == '__main__':
    while start:
        chassis.set_velocity(50,45,0) # 控制机器人移动函数,线速度50(0~100)，方向角45(0~360)，偏航角速度0(-2~2)(The function controls the movement of a robot at the linear velocity of 50 ranging from 0 to 100, the direction angle of 45 ranging from 0 to 360, and the yaw rate of 0 ranging from -2 to 2.)
        time.sleep(1)
        chassis.set_velocity(50,315,0)
        time.sleep(1)
        chassis.set_velocity(50,225,0)
        time.sleep(1)
        chassis.set_velocity(50,135,0)
        time.sleep(1)
    chassis.set_velocity(0,0,0)  # 关闭所有电机(close all motors)
    print('已关闭')
```

Control motor through set_velocity function. There are three parameters in function. Here takes an example of the code `chassis.set_velocity(50,45,0)`:

① The first parameter `50` represents the motor speed, its unit is mm/s and it ranges from -100 to 100. When the value is negative, the motor rotates counterclockwise.

② The second parameter `45` represents the movement direction of car, its unit is degree and it ranges from 0 to 360. The value of 90°refer to move forward. 270°refers to move backward. 0°refers to move to the right. 180°refers to move the left. Other movement directions are obtained according to the same reference method.  

③ The third parameter `0` represents the rotation speed of the car, its unit is 5°/s and it ranges from -2 to 2. When the parameter value is positive, the car will rotate clockwise. When the parameter value is negative, the car will rotate counterclockwise.

### 3.5.5 Function Extension

The default angle of oblique movement is 45°and the value can be modified to adjust the angle. This section will modify the value to 60 and the specific operation steps are as follow:

## 3.6 Drifting Movement

### 3.6.1 Working Principle

According to the characteristic of mecanum wheel characteristics, when the front two wheels do not move, the rear wheel A rotates clockwise and the rear wheel B rotates counterclockwise, the car drift clockwise. The force analysis for car drifting is shown in the following figure:

<img src="../_static/media/6.motion_control_course/1.6/image2.png" class="common_img"   />

According to physical kinematics, when forces are equal and opposite to each other, they will counteract each other. Any force can be decomposed into two perpendicular vectors. Take counterclockwise drifting as example. Suppose the speed of wheel A and wheel B rotates at the same speed, a upward force decomposed by wheel A and a downward force decomposed by wheel B will counteract each other, which the direction of resultant velocity is to the right. 
Based on Newton's second law (F=ma), if the direction of acceleration is to the right, so the final resultant force is also to the right. At this time, if the front wheel does not move, the car will drift.
